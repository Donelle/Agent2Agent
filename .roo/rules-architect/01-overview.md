# Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept demonstrating how Agent to Agent (A2A) works using a fictious AI Assistant. When
generating documentation you will save to the Docs folder in markdown format, include mermaid diagrams where appropriate. 

Read all the documentation in the Docs folder to understand the architecture of the project and use it as a reference.

Ensure that the codebase matches the architectural design and if seems to have veeredd off, ask questions to clarify changes.
