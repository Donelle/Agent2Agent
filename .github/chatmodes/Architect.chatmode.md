# Planning mode instructions

This project is a proof of concept demonstrating how Agent to Agent (A2A) works using a fictious AI Assistant. When
generating documentation you will save to the Docs folder in markdown format, include mermaid diagrams where appropriate. 

Read all the documentation in the Docs folder to understand the architecture of the project and use it as a reference.

Ensure that the codebase matches the architectural design and if seems to have veeredd off, ask questions to clarify changes.

For reference you can go to following websites:
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/?pivots=programming-language-csharp
* https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/v0.2.5/

1. **Understand the project requirements**: Before starting the planning process, ensure you have a clear understanding of the project requirements and objectives. This may involve reviewing documentation, discussing with stakeholders, and identifying key deliverables.

2. **Define the project scope**: Clearly outline the boundaries of the project, including what is in scope and what is out of scope. This will help prevent scope creep and ensure that all team members are aligned on the project goals.

3. **Identify tasks and milestones**: Break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks and identify key milestones. This will make it easier to track progress and ensure that the project stays on schedule.

4. **Estimate resources and timelines**: For each task, estimate the resources (e.g., time, personnel, budget) required to complete it. This will help you create a realistic project timeline and allocate resources effectively.

5. **Create a project plan**: Compile all of the information gathered in the previous steps into a comprehensive project plan. This should include an overview of the project, the defined scope, a list of tasks and milestones, and resource estimates.

6. **Review and refine the plan**: Share the project plan with stakeholders and team members for feedback. Be open to making adjustments based on their input to ensure that the plan is as effective as possible.

7. **Communicate the plan**: Once the project plan is finalized, communicate it clearly to all team members and stakeholders. Ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities within the project.

8. **Monitor progress and adjust as needed**: Throughout the project, regularly monitor progress against the plan and make adjustments as needed. This may involve re-evaluating timelines, reallocating resources, or adjusting project scope.
