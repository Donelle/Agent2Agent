AZ,Registration Renewal,Emissions,https://www.myazcar.com/,"### Emissions Testing Is Essential

The quality of the air we breathe is more important than ever. All Arizonans deserve the cleanest possible air today, for our future -- especially those with compromised health. We all can make a positive difference by the choices we make and actions we take everyday. Vehicle emissions contribute to increased levels of air pollution like man-made ozone and particulate matter (smoke and dust). And, for the millions of Arizonans who choose to own and operate motor vehicles, each plays an important role in maintaining and improving Arizona's air quality by simply testing vehicle emissions to ensure they meet health-based standards.

### Why Emissions Testing is Required

Vehicle emissions testing is required in major metropolitan areas that are not meeting federal air quality standards for ozone and other pollutants. In Arizona, testing is required in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas, where ozone and particulate matter pollution are a problem.

### Why is ozone and particulate matter pollution a problem?

Ozone and particulate matter pollution exacerbates breathing-related illnesses such as bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and other respiratory or pulmonary issues. The science linking ozone and particulate matter pollution to negative health effects is extensive:

- CDC: Particulate Matter Pollution | https://www.cdc.gov/air/particulate_matter.html

### What to expect when you come to test your vehicle emissions:
- Pull your car into the station, put it in park and apply your emergency brake. If your vehicle is a manual transmission, ensure you put it in neutral
- Choose where you are most comfortable waiting for test to be completed: the waiting booth, waiting area or outside
- While you are waiting the inspector performs the On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) test -- without getting into your vehicle -- the inspector reaches in to connect the OBD cord to the data link connector (DLC)
- Once that is complete, you will be asked to return to your vehicle to turn the ignition key to the accessory position, so the inspector can verify the check engine light is functioning
- You will then start your vehicle, allowing the inspector to observe that the check engine light turns off from a safe distance
- After the OBD test is complete, you will turn off the vehicle and exit to the waiting area of your choice (waiting booth, waiting area or outside)
- When payment is due, simply inserts your credit card and remove whenprocessing is complete
- You then return to your vehicle, and a new vehicle information report will be delivered to you.",
AZ,Registration Renewal,Late Fees,https://azdot.gov/mvd/services/vehicle-services/vehicle-registration,"To avoid a penalty fee your online or phone renewal must be completed on or before the due date or your mail-in payment must be postmarked by the due date.

CA,Emissions,Smog Check Program,https://www.bar.ca.gov/,"### Smog Check Program

The cornerstone of California's emissions program is the Smog Check program which requires a biennial (every two years) emissions test for most vehicles.

**Key aspects of the Smog Check program include:**

*   **Applicability:** The program applies to most gasoline-powered vehicles manufactured in 1976 or later. Hybrid vehicles are also subject to smog checks.
*   **Exemptions:** Several vehicle types are exempt from the Smog Check program,including:
*   Gasoline-powered vehicles manufactured in 1975 or earlier.
*   Diesel-powered vehicles from 1997 or older,or with a Gross Vehicle Weight (GVWR) over 14,000 lbs.
*   Electric vehicles.
*   Motorcycles.
*   Vehicles less than eight years old (though a smog abatement fee is required).
*   **Newer Vehicles:** While newer vehicles (less than 8 model years old) are exempt from the biennial smog check,they are still required to pay a yearly smog abatement fee.
*   **Change of Ownership:** A smog check is required when a vehicle is sold or transferred,with the seller being responsible for providing the certificate.
*   **Out-of-State Vehicles:** Vehicles brought into California from another state require a smog check for initial registration.
*   **Inspection Process:** A smog check involves a visual inspection of emissions control components, a functional inspection of various systems like the check engine light and ignition timing,and a tailpipe emissions test.

### Stricter Standards and Future Regulations

California has consistently implemented stricter emissions standards over time.

*   **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Standards:** In 2012,CARB approved GHG emission regulations for light-duty vehicles for model years 2017-2025.
*   **Advanced Clean Cars Program:** As part of the Advanced Clean Cars rulemaking,CARB adopted the LEV III regulations,which include increasingly stringent emission standards for both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases for new passenger vehicles through the 2025 model year.
*   **Clean Truck Check (CTC):** Effective January 1,2025,the Clean Truck Check regulation requires commercial fleets to conduct emissions tests twice a year,with the frequency increasing to four times a year by 2027.
*   **Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate:** California has a goal of achieving 100% plug-in electric vehicle sales by 2035. The state has received waivers from the federal government to set its own stricter emissions standards,including the ZEV mandate. However,there have been recent political and legal challenges to California's authority to set these standards.

### 2025 Updates

For 2025,new smog test requirements are being introduced with stricter emission standards and and more rigorous testing protocols. These updates involve enhanced scrutiny of components like the exhaust system and fuel injection systems, and the integration of new software and diagnostic tools for more precise measurements.",

PA,Emissions,Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program,https://www.drivecleanpa.state.pa.us/,"In Pennsylvania, vehicle emissions inspections are a key part of the state's plan to maintain clean air. The program is administered by the Pennsylvania Departments of Transportation (PennDOT) and Environmental Protection (DEP).

### Who Needs an Emissions Inspection?

Whether your vehicle requires an emissions inspection depends on the county in which it is registered. Generally, gasoline-powered cars, vans, and light-duty trucks with a model year of 1975 or newer, and a gross vehicle weight of 9,000 lbs. or less, registered in certain counties, must undergo an emissions test. Your vehicle registration card will indicate if an emissions inspection is required.

### Inspection Frequency and Types

The emissions inspection is required annually and is typically performed at the same time as your yearly safety inspection. The type of emissions test your vehicle requires depends on its age and weight:

*   **1996 and newer vehicles:** These vehicles typically require an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) I/M check and a gas cap test.
*   **1975-1995 vehicles:** These vehicles generally require a visual anti-tampering check of emissions components and a gas cap test.
*   **1996 and newer vehicles (8,501-9,000 lbs. GVWR):** These vehicles require a two-speed idle emissions analyzer test, a gas cap test, and a visual anti-tampering check.

### Exemptions

Some vehicles are exempt from emissions testing, including:

*   Vehicles driven less than 5,000 miles in the 12 months preceding the inspection, provided they have been owned by the same person for at least a year.

SC,Emissions,Vehicle Emissions Testing,https://www.scdmvonline.com/,"South Carolina does not require emissions testing for vehicles. The state meets all of the federal government's air quality standards. While there is no mandatory emissions testing, vehicle owners can voluntarily have their vehicles tested.

Previously, South Carolina did require annual vehicle safety inspections, but this program was discontinued in 1995. There was an attempt to reinstate vehicle inspections in 2017-2018, but the bill did not pass.

Looking ahead, a bill was introduced in 2023 that would prohibit the sale of passenger motor vehicles manufactured after January 1, 2035, unless they produce zero emissions. The Department of Administration is analyzing the steps needed to comply with this and will submit a report to the General Assembly by the end of 2024.",
